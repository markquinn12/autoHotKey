My autoHotKey script for development tasks

http://www.autohotkey.com/

AutoHotkey is a free, open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows, initially aimed at providing easy keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation and software automation that allows users of most levels of computer skill to automate repetitive tasks in any Microsoft Windows application.

AutoHotKey can be used for a variety of tasks. Here you will find some scripts and ideas.

##To Install:
choco install autohotkey

or if you don't use chocolatey then direct from: http://www.autohotkey.com/

##To Run:
Download my sample script: [autoHotKey.ahk](autoHotKey.ahk)

You can double click on the .ahk file, this will execute the script and listen for commands. You can then see the autoHotKey icon on the task bar.

A good idea is to create a shortcut to the script. Then place this shortcut in the windows "startup" folder which will execute the script upon startup.

There is also an Autocorrect script which is very useful. This can be found [here:](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoCorrect.ahk).

Just download and run the same as the script above.

##Development:

You can use [scite4ahk](http://fincs.ahk4.net/scite4ahk/) for basic autoHotKey development and debugging.

Debugging usage can be found here: [scite4ahk](http://fincs.ahk4.net/scite4ahk/pages/debugger.htm)

Only tested on Windows 7.
