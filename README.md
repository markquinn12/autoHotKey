AutoHotkey is a free, open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows, initially aimed at providing easy keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation and software automation that allows users of most levels of computer skill to automate repetitive tasks in any Microsoft Windows application.

AutoHotKey can be used for a variety of tasks. Here you will find some scripts and ideas.

##To Install:
choco install autohotkey

or if you don't use chocolatey then direct from: http://www.autohotkey.com/

##To Run:
You can double click on the .ahk file, this will execute the script and listen for commands. You can then see the autoHotKey icon on the task bar.

A good idea is to create a shortcut to the script. Then place this shortcut in the windows "startup" folder which will execute the script upon startup.
