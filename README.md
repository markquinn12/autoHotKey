My autoHotKey script for development tasks

http://www.autohotkey.com/

AutoHotkey is a free, open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows, initially aimed at providing easy keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation and software automation that allows users of most levels of computer skill to automate repetitive tasks in any Microsoft Windows application.

AutoHotKey can be used for a variety of tasks. Here you will find some scripts and ideas.

##To Install:
`choco install autohotkey`

or if you don't use chocolatey then direct from: http://www.autohotkey.com/

##Script usage:
I have added 2 scripts to the repository.

The script which I currently use:  [autoHotKey.ahk](autoHotKey.ahk).

There is also a script which I used in the past: [autoHotKeyMaster.ahk](autoHotKeyMaster.ahk). This is the script I used before I moved some of my automation tasks to [PhraseExpress](http://www.phraseexpress.com/). This script has alot more utilites and tasks than the [autoHotKey.ahk](autoHotKey.ahk) file.

##To Run:
Download either of my scripts!

You can double click on the .ahk file, this will execute the script and listen for commands. You can then see the autoHotKey icon on the task bar.

If you have run my [autoHotKeyMaster.ahk](autoHotKeyMaster.ahk) file then you can view a list of all hotkeys which I have created by pressing: WinKey + CapsLock.

A good idea is to create a shortcut to the script. Then place this shortcut in the windows "startup" folder which will execute the script upon startup.

Remember the script will have to be edited as each person's environment is different.

There is also an Autocorrect script which is very useful. This can be found [here:](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoCorrect.ahk)

Just download and run the same as the script above.

##Development:

You can use [scite4ahk](http://fincs.ahk4.net/scite4ahk/) for basic autoHotKey development and debugging.

I have added lots of comments to my [.ahk](autoHotKeyMaster.ahk) file, so please read through the comments for an explanation of each hotkey and hotstring which I have created.

Debugging usage can be found here: [scite4ahk](http://fincs.ahk4.net/scite4ahk/pages/debugger.htm)

Only tested on Windows 7.
