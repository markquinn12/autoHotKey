# autoHotKey
My autoHotKey script for development

AutoHotKey can be used for a variety of tasks. Here you will find some scripts and ideas.

To Install:
choco install autohotkey

or if you don't use chocolatey then direct from: http://www.autohotkey.com/

To Run:
You can double click on the .ahk file, this will execute the script and listen for commands.

I have saved this script and then added a shortcut to the script. I placed this shortcut in the windows "startup" folder which will execute the script upon startup.
